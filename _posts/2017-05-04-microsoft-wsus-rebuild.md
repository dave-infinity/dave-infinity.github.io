To re-install WSUS with a clean database i.e. no previous configuration:

Run Windows Powershell as Administrator and use the following commands:

- Uninstall-WindowsFeature -Name UpdateServices,Windows-Internal-Database -Restart

- Post restart, delete EVERYTHING in the C:\\Windows\\WID\\ (for Win 2012 r2) folder.

- Then run the following command to re-install WSUS:  
    Install-WindowsFeature UpdateServices -Restart

This only works on PowerShell 3 or higher.

UPDATE  
I had to run the postinstallation tasks manually via Powershell using the WID db, if using SQL you need to add in sql\_instance=

C:\\Program Files\\Update Services\\Tools\\WsusUtil.exe content\_dir=‚Äù&lt;&lt;dir of update download location&gt;&gt;
