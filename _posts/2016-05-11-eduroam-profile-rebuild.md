There is a known issue with certain wireless access points and some clients. The solution is to:

1\. Forget the Eduroam network from your device

2\. Using your mobile data connection or via OWL (if you use OWL you will need to connect to it, close the browser pop up, connect to it again and close the browser pop up a second time – now you will have the option to “Use without Internet”) visit :  
http://cat.eduroam.org

3\. Download the configuration tool for your device and launch it, entering your username in the format kebl1234@ox.ac.uk along with your Eduroam / Remote Access password

4\. Now connect to the Eduroam network and all should be well.
