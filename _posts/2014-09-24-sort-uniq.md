| **Syntax** | **Usage** |
|:-:|:-:|
| sort &lt;filename&gt; | Sort the lines in the specified file |
| cat file1 file2 \| sort | Append the two files, then sort the lines and display the output on the terminal |
| sort -r &lt;filename&gt; | Sort the lines in reverse order |

To remove duplicate entries from some files, use the following command:

```
sort file1 file2 | uniq > file3
```

To count the number of duplicate entries, use the following command:

```
uniq -c filename
```

PASTE:  
To paste contents from two files one can do:

```
$ paste file1 file2
```

The syntax to use a different delimiter is as follows:

```
$ paste -d, file1 file2
```

Common delimiters are ‘space’, ‘tab’, ‘|’, ‘comma’, etc.

JOIN:  
To combine two files on a common field, at the command prompt type

```
join file1 file2
```

and press the Enter key.

SPLIT:  
By default split breaks up a file into 1,000-line segments. The original file remains unchanged, and set of new files with the same name plus an added prefix is created. By default, the x prefix is added. To split a file into segments, use the command

```
$ split <file_to_split_> <name files="" of="" split=""></name></file_to_split_>
```
