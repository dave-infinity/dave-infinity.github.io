Issuing “apt-get update” or “apt-get upgrade” commands resulted in the following error:

```
E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)
E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?

```

I couldn’t locate any running processes which would be locking these files so went ahead and removed the lock files via:

```
sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock
sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock
sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock

```

And then repeated the commands successfully.
