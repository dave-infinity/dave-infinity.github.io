A Brother DCP-7055 had a new toner installed which is failed to recognise.

Resetting the counter resolved the problem:

1\. Open the front door to access the toner

2\. Press the “Clear” button.

3\. Press the “Start” button.

(When you press START the screen should clear.)

4\. Press the “↓” or “Down Arrow” button.

5\. Press the “↑” or “Up Arrow” button.

(When you press the down arrow an ‘E0′ should appear, which will change to ’00′ when you press the up arrow)

6\. Press the “OK” button.

(When it say s ‘ACCEPTED’)

7\. Close the front door.
