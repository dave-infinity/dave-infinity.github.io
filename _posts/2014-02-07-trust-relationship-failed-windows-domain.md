### 2016-07-21 UPDATE:

Discovered this thread which mentions using PowerShell to reset the machine password, if you havenâ€™t completed the registry change:

Open PowerShell as administrator. Run this command sequence:

```
$credential = Get-Credential
```

(enter domain admin account when prompted)

```
Reset-ComputerMachinePassword -Server <<YOUR DC NAME HERE>>
```
