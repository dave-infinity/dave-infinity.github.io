The Doctor’s EMIS software was unable to print to the Brother laserjet printer. It printed fine from Windows and other software.

The problem was with the configuration of the printer from within EMIS. Once the Doctor was logged into the system clicking “Config &gt; Printing ” and then de-selecting the “Select Size” (or similier) check box solved the problem of printing, and adjusting the X/Y alignment corrected the final print.
